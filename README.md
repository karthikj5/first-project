**SMS-SPAM DETECTION SYSTEM**

**OBJECTIVES**

1.Design and implement an end-to-end SMS classification system leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) to distinguish between spam and legitimate messages.

2.Enhance text data quality through preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and TF-IDF vectorization for improved model performance.

3.Develop and optimize a Multinomial Naive Bayes model to achieve high accuracy and reliable precision-recall metrics for spam detection.

4.Deploy the trained model using Streamlit, providing an intuitive, real-time interface for users to test SMS messages for spam detection.

5.Evaluate and validate the systemâ€™s effectiveness through comprehensive performance metrics to ensure robustness and scalability.
